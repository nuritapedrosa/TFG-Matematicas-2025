# 🏙️ MILP-Based Optimization of Urban Metro Networks

This repository contains the full implementation of a mathematical model for designing efficient subway layouts under real-world constraints,  using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP).

## 📘 Overview

The project is based on an academic thesis focused on designing subway systems that balance construction cost and strategic station coverage. The approach is formulated as a MILP problem and solved with standard optimization tools.

Key objectives include:
- Minimizing the total cost (or track length) required for the network.
- Maximizing the number of strategically important stations served.
- Ensuring a set of structural and operational constraints are satisfied.

The methodology is designed to be adaptable to different urban layouts, and the code allows for easy parameter modification to suit other cities or hypothetical planning scenarios.
